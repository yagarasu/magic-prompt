# magic-prompt
My personal bash prompt

## How to use
Clone this repo or download it or copy-paste it... you just need the `magic-prompt.sh` file in your system. Then you just need to source it in your `.bash_profile`

```
source ~/magic-prompt.sh
```

## Notes
This is still in development, kinda. I'm not really supporting it or anything like that, I just wanted to share this thing :)
